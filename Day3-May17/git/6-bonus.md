## "I found this push-button Git app, it's so easy!"

Fine, but:

- Every graphical interface for git is feature-incomplete
- In your career, you _will_ encounter tricky situations that require using the Git command line
    - Working in remote servers
    - Interactive rebase
    - Submodules
    - Rescuing lost commits from the reflog
    - Automated (scripted) use of Git

If you avoid the CLI until you're in a pinch, you face the steepest learning curve at the worst possible time. If you build the CLI skills and habits now, you'll become a total pro, and your skills will transfer to other tools. 😎

## Alternatives to GitHub

## Job Interview Advice

Ask about their use of revision control!

For a software/infra engineering job:

- Standard correct answer
  - "Everyone on the team uses Git"
- Run away
  - "We don't use a revision control system"
    - This is like a hospital with no medical record-keeping
  - "We're in the process of adopting git"
    - Expect chaos in this workplace 
  - "We use CVS / Subversion / Source Safe"
    - This workplace is trapped in 2005
- Weird / interesting
  - "We use Mercurial / Perforce"
    - Expect other less-mainstream tech choices too
