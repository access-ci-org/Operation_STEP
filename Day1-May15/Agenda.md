### Git Setup

_An iOS or Android device won't work. They need to use a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer._

1. Follow these directions <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git> to install git. Students don't need to install "GitHub Desktop", just git.
2. Confirm that each student can open a command prompt (a.k.a. terminal or shell) and run `git version`.
3. Create an account on <https://github.com> if student doesn't have one already
